# MXN Logo Implementation Guide

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete!

Your MXN logo has been successfully implemented in the website! Here's what has been done:

1. The MXN logo image has been saved at `/public/images/mxn-logo.png`
2. The `Logo` component in `/src/components/Logo.tsx` has been updated to support displaying the logo image
3. The `Header` component has been updated to use the Logo component with the image option enabled

## üîç What You're Seeing

The logo is now visible in the header of your website. The Logo component is configured to:
- Use the MXN logo image by default (with a fallback to the original SVG)
- Include animations for an engaging user experience
- Display with text showing "Menagenix"

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Customize the Logo

### Size Options

The Logo component accepts different size options:

```jsx
<Logo size="sm" /> // Small
<Logo size="md" /> // Medium (default)
<Logo size="lg" /> // Large
<Logo size="xl" /> // Extra Large
```

### Showing/Hiding Text

You can control whether the text appears next to the logo:

```jsx
<Logo showText={true} /> // Show "Menagenix" text (default)
<Logo showText={false} /> // Hide text, show only logo
```

### Animation Control

Enable or disable the logo animations:

```jsx
<Logo animated={true} /> // Enable animations (default)
<Logo animated={false} /> // Disable animations
```

### Logo Type

Switch between the image and SVG versions:

```jsx
<Logo useImage={true} /> // Use the MXN logo image (default)
<Logo useImage={false} /> // Use the SVG geometric logo
```

## üì± Responsive Behavior

The logo size adapts automatically on different screen sizes through the component's responsive design.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. If you want to replace the logo with a higher quality version:
   - Save the new image as `/public/images/mxn-logo.png` (replacing the existing one)
   - For best results, use a PNG format with transparent background

2. If you want to use the logo in other places in your website:
   - Import and use the Logo component in any React component:
   ```jsx
   import Logo from '../components/Logo';
   
   // Then use it in your component
   <Logo size="lg" showText={false} />
   ```

3. Explore adding the logo to the site's favicon:
   - Replace the file at `/public/favicon.svg` with your logo

Enjoy your new branding implementation!
