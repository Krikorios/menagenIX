# MXN Logo Implementation Guide

Hi there! I've set up your website to use the MXN logo you provided. Here's what I've done and what you need to do next:

## Changes Made

1. **Created an images folder**: Set up `/public/images/` to store your logo
2. **Updated the Logo component**: Modified `Logo.tsx` to support both image and SVG versions
3. **Updated the Header**: Changed the header to use your new logo
4. **Added documentation**: Created `LOGO_SETUP.md` with detailed instructions

## Next Steps

1. **Add your logo image**:
   - Save your MXN logo as `/public/images/mxn-logo.png`
   - Make sure it's a PNG with transparency for best results

2. **Preview your changes**:
   - Run `npm run dev` (I've already started the server for you)
   - Visit http://localhost:5173 to see how it looks

## Logo Implementation Options

The Logo component now has a new prop: `useImage` (defaults to true)
- `useImage={true}` uses your PNG logo image
- `useImage={false}` uses the original SVG geometric logo

## Custom Sizing

You can control the logo size across the site using these props:
- `size="sm"` (small)
- `size="md"` (medium - default)
- `size="lg"` (large)
- `size="xl"` (extra large)

## Need More Help?

See the detailed instructions in `LOGO_SETUP.md` for additional customization options.

## Error Resolution

You might see some TypeScript errors related to missing type declarations. These should not affect the functionality of your website, but if you want to fix them:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom @types/react-router-dom
```

Enjoy your new logo implementation!
